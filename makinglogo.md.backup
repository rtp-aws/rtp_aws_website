Calcs from handwritten notes

```

width of mouth is from center of eye to center of eye.  
Consider eye width as 1 unit.  
Consider eye to eye width as 3 units.  

width of mouth = 1 + 1/2  + 1/2  
               = 2 

maintain the aws mouth width
width mouth = 227 pixels = 2 eye width
width eye = 227/2 = 113

nose width = 1 eye width = 113 
```

To maintain proportion of mouth (dimple) and RTP triangle, mirror the aws smile horizontally.  Then slide nose with a slight adjustment to right as the smile
is turning to left.

As light shines on nose, the protrusion is pronounced an the conjunction is dissolved.
